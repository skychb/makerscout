I've never felt uncomfortable about template engine with FE, having used 'handlebars' as template engine.
In fact, I didn't get needs for other engines like angular, react, etc. looping for DOM, inserting contents exactly where they should be were all I need when I code for web.
Then, I googled why we should react. There was one documents for people like me ![link, Korean](http://webframeworks.kr/tutorials/react/getting-started/).
>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JS library for building UI. it has a few different kinds of components.

well.. It does not reach me. following tutorials would be helpful for understanding tools and identities.
